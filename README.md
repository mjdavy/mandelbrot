# mandelbrot
Mandlebrot set plot implementation in Rust

This is based on the example from the O'Reilly "Crab" book, but has some updates to use Rayon instead of crossbeam and also adapted to suppor color.
The purpose of this repo is really a learning tool to become more fluent with Rust language, ecosystem and tooling
